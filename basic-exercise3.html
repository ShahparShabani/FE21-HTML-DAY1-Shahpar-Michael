            <p>The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
                    Not a footprint to be seen
                    A kingdom of isolation
                    And it looks like I'm the queen</p></div>
        <div><p>The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
                Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
                Don't let them in, don't let them see
                Be the good girl you always have to be
                Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
                Well, now they know</p></div>
        <div><p>Let it go, let it go
                Can't hold it back anymore
                Let it go, let it go
                Turn away and slam the door
                I don't care what they're going to say
                Let the storm rage on
                The cold never bothered me anyway</p></div>
        <div><p>It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
                And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
                It's time to see what I can do
                To test the limits and break through
                No right, no wrong, no rules for me
                I'm free</p></div>
